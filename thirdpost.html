                        <p>For decades, economists, politicians, and the public have discussed the merits of raising the minimum wage. Opponents point out that it might have a number of negative effects, despite the fact that supporters claim that it will make low-wage people's lives better and reduce income disparity. We'll go over two potential cons of raising the minimum wage. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Job Loss</h2>
                        <p>The possibility of job loss is the first significant disadvantage of raising the minimum wage. In reaction to rising labor expenses, employers may decide to reduce hours or reduce the number of employees, especially in sectors with narrow profit margins. This is so that businesses can preserve their profitability and possibly discover strategies to adapt to the rising cost of labor. A higher minimum wage would also encourage businesses to use automated kiosks or self-checkout lanes in place of workers, which would make the problem of job loss even worse. Therefore, while increasing the minimum wage may increase the incomes of certain individuals, it may result in the loss of employment for other workers. </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Inflation</h2>
                        <p>Inflation may result from raising the minimum wage, which is the second significant disadvantage. Businesses may raise pricing to reflect rising labor costs and pass those costs on to customers. The expense of living could increase in a chain reaction as a result of rising costs. Low-income households may find it more difficult to make ends meet as a result, which may partially undo the benefits of raising the minimum wage in the first place. Therefore, even if increasing the minimum wage may seem like a good idea, it's vital to think about what impact it might have on the economy as a whole. </p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">Here is an image showing the nominal minimum wage vs the real minimum wage adjusted for inflation. Image from The Washington Post.</span>
                        <p>When you look at the real value of minimum wage you see that it hasn't actually grown since 1968. Each time the minimum wage is increased, inflation just goes up and the dollar is has a lower and lower buying power. Raising the minimum wage is not the easy solution that everyone is looking for.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, increasing the minimum wage is a contentious matter with benefits and drawbacks. It might lessen poverty and economic inequality, but it might also result in inflation, job losses, and unanticipated labor market effects. Before raising the minimum wage, policymakers should carefully weigh each of these considerations and strive to strike a balance between safeguarding low-income employees and preserving a robust economy. </p>
