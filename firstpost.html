                        <h2 class="section-heading">What are sticky wages?</h2>
                        <p>In the United States economy, working wages tend to stay or “stick” at their current value, not able to increase or decrease. This is called Sticky Wage Theory, which exists in all workplaces and fields.</p>
                        <p>The demand for work could factor in how much an employer pays. Throughout the United States’ history, poor non-white groups will work for less than their white counterparts, as it may be a slight improvement of living. If there are people willing to work for less, employers view their employees as replaceable.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">You may copy or replace this code if you want to quote someone. Four lines of quotation or more (on the page) should be in block quotes, which is why these containers are called block quotes. Not creative but effective.</blockquote>
                        <p>Employers may not pay efficiency wages. In 1914, Henry Ford introduced efficiency wages in the automobile industry by doubling the wage for each employee. This resulted in a more stable workplace, lower training costs, higher productivity, and a boost to all profits (EconPort). Employers do not pay efficiency wages because they either disregard them or do not have the funds to do so.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How do sticky wages compare to inflation rates?</h2>
                        <p>March 2020 marked the beginning of a mandatory lockdown due to the spread of COVID-19. This was a period of unemployment, company bankruptcy, and supply chain issues. This period has been the worst economic crisis since the Great Recession in the late 2000s. To combat this issue, the United States government has added more money into circulation. However, this causes major problems. If there is more money in circulation, the inflation rate will rise.</p>
                       <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/inflation graph.png" alt="this is a description of your image for accessibility" /></a> 
                       
                        <span class="caption text-muted">"Overall prices rose 6.2 percent over the past 12 months (2020 to 2021), the fastest pace since 1990, and inflation began to accelarate again on a monthly basis." - Jeanna Smialek (The New York Times)</span>
                        <p>An increased inflation rate equates to higher prices of goods and services. Even though prices will increase, sticky wages do not give workers a high enough earning to pay for things at this increased price.</p>
                        <p>So, what happens when consumers can’t afford goods and services? If employers do not receive enough funds to either breakeven or make a profit, prices for their goods and services will increase. This cycle does not allow for non-flexible wages to benefit U.S. workers.</p>
